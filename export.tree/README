# README

We present a multimodal dataset of intracranial recordings, fMRI, and eye tracking in 20 human participants 
as they watched the same movie stimulus. Intracranial recordings consist of single neurons, local field potential, 
and intracranial EEG activity recorded concurrently from depth electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, 
and medial frontal cortex while participants underwent intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. 

Participants watched an 8-min long excerpt from the video “Bang! You’re Dead” and performed a recognition memory test for movie content. 
3T fMRI activity was recorded prior to surgery in 11 of these participants while performing the same task. 
This NWB- and BIDS-formatted dataset includes the spike times of all neurons, field potential activity, behavior, 
eye tracking, electrode locations, demographics, and functional and structural MRI scans. For technical validation, 
we provide signal quality metrics, assess eye tracking quality, behavior, the tuning of cells and high-frequency broadband power field potentials 
to familiarity and event boundaries, and show brain-wide inter-subject correlations for fMRI. 

This dataset will facilitate the investigation of brain activity during movie watching, recognition memory, and the neural basis of the fMRI-BOLD signal.
